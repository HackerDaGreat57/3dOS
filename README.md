# 3dOS
This project aims to (eventually) compete with Microsoft Windows. Therefore, I do not trust GitHub, a Microsoft-hosted service, with my code. ~~The repository is located [here](https://7fad-2601-647-5580-7a50-6fa7-d0be-c676-cc32.ngrok.io/HackerDaGreat57/3dOS).~~

## Server Updates (newest to oldest)
**Update 12/9/2022 11:15 AM (PST):** The new server is nearly ready... probably will be up by 10 PM today.


**Update 12/2/2022 3:56 PM (PST):** Since there was a power outage anyway, the server has temporarily gone down for maintenence. I am also working on making it properly port-forwarded instead of using ngrok. *All server data is safe and uncorrupted.*
