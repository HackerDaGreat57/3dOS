# 3dOS
This project aims to (eventually) compete with Microsoft Windows. Therefore, I do not trust GitHub, a Microsoft-hosted service, with my code. The repository is located [here](https://7fad-2601-647-5580-7a50-6fa7-d0be-c676-cc32.ngrok.io/HackerDaGreat57/3dOS). Since I am running ngrok's free plan, the URL will be updated if the server crashes. (Server uptime: above 99%. I have been running the same session of ngrok for about a week now, so it's stable AFAIK.)

11/28/2022 8:20 AM (PST): Server offline for a few hours for backup. Will be up soon, ngrok URL will not change.
